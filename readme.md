# CSGame
A simple 2D/3D hybrid game built using [CSEngine](https://github.com/ConnorSweeneyDev/CSEngine).

# How to Build
This project uses my custom zero dependency bootstrapped build system called
[CSBuild](https://github.com/ConnorSweeneyDev/CSBuild).\
On Windows, run `script\build.bat`. On Linux, run `./script/build.sh`.
